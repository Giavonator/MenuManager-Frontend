## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:
- Network errors with retry options
- Form validation with clear error messages
- Loading states for all operations
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Graceful handling of API response variations

## Responsive Design

The components are fully responsive and work well on:
- Desktop computers
- Tablets
- Mobile phones

## Browser Compatibility

The implementation uses modern Vue 3 features and should work in:
- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

## Known Issues and Limitations

1. **Delete Menu**: The API specification doesn't include a delete menu endpoint, so this functionality shows a "not implemented" message.

2. **API Response Format**: The `_getMenusOwnedByUser` API returns `menus` as a string in the spec, but the implementation handles various possible formats.

3. **Backend Dependency**: All functionality requires the backend server to be running and properly configured.

## Recent Fixes

### Date Display Issue (Fixed)
**Problem**: When creating a menu for date 10/31/2025, it was displaying as 10/30/2025.

**Root Cause**: The `formatDate` function was using `new Date(dateString)` which can cause timezone conversion issues. When JavaScript parses a date string like "2025-10-31", it interprets it as UTC midnight, which when converted to local time (especially in timezones behind UTC) can result in the previous day.

**Solution**: Updated the `formatDate` function to parse the date string manually and create a Date object in local timezone:
```javascript
const [year, month, day] = dateString.split('-').map(Number)
const date = new Date(year, month - 1, day) // month is 0-indexed
```

This ensures that the date is always interpreted in the local timezone without any UTC conversion issues.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
1. Menu templates
2. Recipe search and filtering
3. Menu sharing between users
4. Export menu to shopping list
5. Menu planning calendar view
6. Recipe rating and reviews

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify the backend server is running
3. Check network connectivity
4. Review the API specification for expected request/response formats
