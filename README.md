Note: I just wanted to say explicitly that my PurchaseSystem concept is not being implemented for this assignment (and reflected in User Journey). There are several reasonings for this.

1. The entirety of my PurchaseSystem concept runs on synchronizations from all of the other concepts. Because of this it was best to wait for assignment 4c to implements the syncs in their appropriate end fashion.
2. I've spent close to 30 hours on this assignment, due to the refactorization of MenuManager concept, implementing new concepts, testing, etc, and simply don't have the time to continue working on this.
3. I understand a rubric is a rubric for grading but I hope but I hope that some understanding can be made. The application works works with five different concepts, and I am just hoping for some wiggle room to implement the last one for the next assignment. Thank you.
