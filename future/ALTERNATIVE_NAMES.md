Essentially the alternative names used to be seomthing that was going to be important with the integration of LLMS into the project. Now though, it is not important, and adds not needed complexity.

1. Figure out what will happen to all of the data already in the database if we try to make the change.
2. Update the spec, implementation, and testing (backend)
3. Update the frontend to no longer have alternative name option.
4. Update frontend to use new actions.
