It’s Tuesday afternoon, and Emma, the head chef for tonight’s cook team, sits down to plan the dinner menu for La Maison Français. Normally she would open a blank Word doc and start writing her five required dishes, but remembers that the house has a new system called *Menu Manager* to help the Food Stewards with the food management process.

Instead, Emma logs into Menu Manager and opens the *Home Page* (see sketch 4.1). Scrolling through the page she is able to see inspiration for the application, and then decides to go to the *Menu Page* to create her menu. She clickes the "Create New Menu" button in the top bar and is redirected to a blank *Menu Page* (sketch 4.2) and starts adding recipes directly. For each dish, she selects ingredients using a text box that allows her to put in the item name, units, and quantity. She continues adding more ingredients and recipes, until her menu is finished.

By the time Emma finishes inputting data into the form, she takes roughly as long as it would have with a Word document. She goes to the *Weekly Cart* page and sees that her menu was added including all of her ingredients. She is happy knowing that she was able to help the *Food Stewards* in simplifying the ingredient aggregation process for them.
