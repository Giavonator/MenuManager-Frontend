# Typography Styling + Layout

I think that the color styling was much more fun to play around with, but I still do have one main example of using typography within the front end.

## Font Selection

After doing some historical research, the primary font that is used within French literature would be a classic serif font Garamond.

For the grand majority of newspapers and government documents the font has been used for a long time. Although the users won't exactly know this, it is a nice hommage to the culture.

## Not Including Others

Ultimately after going through the inspiration of the typography design study, I found that majority of the french typography uses a lot of of different fonts and sizes. In reality, I want my application to be more uniform.

The point I am trying to make here is that instead of going crazy using +10 different fonts and styles, I chose to keep it simple so that the focus of the user will be on using the application rather the amount of different fonts.
